# Argitical

A Fabric Mod for Minecraft 1.18.2 which requires [BRRP](https://github.com/SolidBlock-cn/BRRP) and inspired from Create: Above and Beyond.

This mod adds numbers between -99 to 99 (can be configurable in the future) and you can calculate them in a crafting table or using automation methods by other mods such as Create.

The recipes and items are generated with optimization when the game boot and it will take you 1~2 seconds to init the mod.
